Murder plot suspect pleads not guilty

A second woman charged in connection with an alleged plot to kill a Swedish cartoonist, who depicted the prophet Muhammad with the body of a dog, pleaded not guilty in a U.S. court Wednesday.

Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, 31, was arrested last week in Philadelphia after voluntarily flying back from overseas to face the charge of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists.

Ramirez, who is 12 weeks pregnant, according to her attorney Jeremy Ibrahim, was ordered held pending trial by a judge.

After the hearing, Ibrahim told reporters that Paulin-Ramirez was "distraught" about being separated from her young son and that her family was unable to travel from Colorado to see her. The child is being held by child protective sendees, he said.

Paulin-Ramirez had returned to the United States to "clear her name," Ibrahim said.

He also said he planned to explore questions about her mental state at the time of the alleged activities.
