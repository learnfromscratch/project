President flees capital, dozens killed in nation housing key U.S. base

by Peter Finn

Opposition demonstrators ap peared Wednesday to have seize power in Kyrgyzstan, which i host to an important U.S. militar base, after a day of bloody clashes that left dozens dead and forced the Central Asian country&apos;s president to flee the capital.

Leaders of the opposition said they had taken over key installations in Bishkek and were forming a new government. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev flew to Osh, a regional city where he enjoys support, according to news reports. His plans were uncertain, as was his ability to command the country&apos;s security forces and reassert his authority.

The death toll of about 40 was likelv to rise, health officials in Bishkek said, noting that hundreds of protesters were injured in the violence.

For the United States, the upheaval is of particular concern because its Manas air base, near Bishkek, is a key transit point for supplying troops in Afghanistan. The Obama administration negotiated new lease terms for the facility last year after Bakiyev threatened to evict U.S. forces from the country.

Some in the Kyrgyz opposition accused the United States of ignoring allegations of rigged elections, suppression of independent media and physical intimidation of government critics, attributing its silence to a desire to maintain its military presence in Kyrgyzstan.

A new Kyrgyz government could sow fresh uncertainty over the base to express displeasure with Washington or to extract concessions. Some opposition members earlier called for closing the facility.

Kyrgyzstan is the only country to host both U.S. and Russian military bases. Bakiyev&apos;s move to close Manas was reportedly made under pressure from Russia, which extended Kyrgyzstan a $2 billion loan, but the president reversed course after the United States agreed to pay a higher rent and call the installation a &quot;transit center&quot; rather than a base.

The installation provides a partial alternative to road shipments
