The largest security curtain since Inauguration Day will descend on Washington beginning Sunday closing enough downtown streets to cause two days of gridlock and remind people that living at the center of world political power comes at a price.

More than 40 heads of states will descend on the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Monday and Tuesday for a Nuclear Security Summit that will create massive traffic headaches in one of the city's central commuting corridors. A vast perimeter will be in place to protect President Obama and other world leaders as they discuss how to keep nuclear material out of the hands of terrorists.

There's a potential here to make [the inauguration] look like child's play" said Lon Anderson, a spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic. "This is going to be during business hours, when Washington is a live, bustling city."

Thirteen bus routes will be detoured around the area; Green and Yellow line Metro trains will bypass Mount Vernon Square Station; and traffic on two major ar-
Streets will close about 10 p.m. Sunday and open about 8 p.m. Tuesday. Pedestrians who wantto passthrough fencingaround the Washington Convention Center will be subject to inspection.
teries — New York and Massachusetts avenues — will be an utter mess until the meeting adjourns Tuesday night.

Motorists need to expect the unexpected," Anderson said. "There will be delays. There will be roads closed. There will be detours. It is not going to be a good time for mobility in Washington."

According to guidelines issued by government agencies, residents will be required to show photo ID to reach their homes, and they and their guests — and anything they are carrying — will be screened. Secret Sendee spokesman Max Milien said that screenings could include bag searches and other measures and that authorities could also screen anyone on the "outskirts" of the security zone who "appears suspicious."
